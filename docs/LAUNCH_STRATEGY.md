# 🚀 Smart Money Tracker - Launch Strategy

## Mission: $10K MRR in 30 Days

This isn't a "build and hope" play. This is surgical execution targeting traders who are **already paying** for wallet tracking tools.

---

## Phase 1: Beta Week (Days 1-7)

### Goal: 5 beta users + 10 proven smart wallets

**Day 1-2: Setup**
- [ ] Run monitor for 48 hours to collect baseline data
- [ ] Manually validate top 20 wallets (check their actual performance on pump.fun)
- [ ] Identify 10 wallets with 70+ score and real wins
- [ ] Create Twitter account: @SmartMoneySOL (or similar)
- [ ] Set up Telegram bot and test with your own account

**Day 3-4: Recruit Beta Users**
- [ ] Post in /r/solana: "Built a bot that tracks profitable pump.fun wallets. Need 5 beta testers."
- [ ] Post in /r/CryptoMoonShots with same message
- [ ] Join 5 pump.fun Discord servers, lurk and DM active traders
- [ ] Offer: "Free lifetime Pro if you give feedback for 1 week"

**Day 5-7: Collect Feedback**
- [ ] Daily check-ins with beta users
- [ ] Track: Are alerts timely? Are wallets actually profitable? False positives?
- [ ] Fix critical bugs
- [ ] Document 3-5 winning trades from tracked wallets (screenshot for marketing)

**Success Metric:** 5 active beta users who got at least 1 profitable alert

---

## Phase 2: Public Launch (Days 8-14)

### Goal: 50 paying users = $2,450 MRR

**Pre-Launch Prep (Day 8)**

- [ ] Prepare 10 tweets showcasing winning trades
- [ ] Join 10 more pump.fun/Solana trading Discord servers

**Launch Day (Day 9)**
- [ ] Tweet thread: "I tracked the top 100 pump.fun wallets for 7 days. Here's what I found..." [Thread with stats and link]
- [ ] Post in /r/solana: "I built a tool to copy profitable pump.fun traders" [with beta results]
- [ ] Post in /r/CryptoMoonShots: Same as above
- [ ] Post in 10 Discord #general channels: "Just launched Smart Money Tracker - tracks profitable wallets on pump.fun. DM for early access."

## Anti-Patterns (DON'T DO THIS)

❌ **Building more features before getting users** - You have an MVP. Ship it.
❌ **Perfectionism** - Ship with bugs. Fix them when users complain.
❌ **Passive marketing** - "Build it and they will come" doesn't work. Be aggressive.
❌ **Underpricing** - $49/mo is CHEAP if it helps someone make $1K. Don't go lower.
❌ **Ignoring feedback** - If 3 users say the same thing, it's real. Fix it.
❌ **Chasing vanity metrics** - Signups don't matter. Paying users matter.

---

## What Success Looks Like

**Week 2:** First $2K month. You can pay rent.
**Week 4:** First $10K month. You're alive.
**Week 8:** First $25K month. You're profitable.
**Week 12:** First $50K month. You won.

---

## Emergency Pivots

**If no one signs up after week 1:**
- Product problem: Alerts aren't valuable. Need better wallets or faster alerts.
- Distribution problem: Not reaching target audience. Try different channels.
- Messaging problem: Not communicating value. Show $$ results, not features.

**If high churn (>10%):**
- Alert quality issue: Too many false positives. Increase score threshold.
- Competition: Someone copied you. Add moat (exclusive wallets, better UX).
- Market timing: Pump.fun hype died. Pivot to another chain/DEX.

**If growth plateaus at <100 users:**
- You're not being aggressive enough on distribution.
- Add referral program immediately.
- Do paid ads or influencer marketing.

## Final Word

You're not building a SaaS. You're building a **money printer for traders**.

Every alert that helps someone 10x their bag is a testimonial. Every testimonial is free marketing. Every new user increases the network effect (more tracked wallets = better signals).

This is a winner-take-most market. First mover with best UX wins. You have 60 days to lock in 500+ users before competitors wake up.

**Stop building. Start selling.**
