## Week 1: Beta Launch + Social Proof

### Day 1 (Monday)

**Morning (8-10 AM)** 🔥
"I tracked 100 pump.fun wallets for 7 days. Only 12 were consistently profitable.

Here's what separates winners from losers: [thread with data]

1/10"

**Afternoon (2-4 PM)** 📊
"Why most pump.fun traders lose:

❌ They buy after the pump
❌ No research, pure FOMO
❌ Follow shillers, not winners

✅ Solution: Track wallets that actually make money

I built a bot that does this. Testing with 5 beta users this week."

**Evening (7-9 PM)** 💬
"Quick poll: How do you currently find profitable pump.fun plays?

A) Twitter hype
B) Discord alpha
C) Your own research
D) Follow whale wallets

Reply below 👇"

### Day 2 (Tuesday)

**Morning** 🔥
"🚨 TRACKED WALLET ALERT

Wallet 7xKX...sAsU just bought $PEPE at $0.00012

This wallet:
- 73% win rate (22W/8L)
- +340% ROI last 7 days
- Avg hold: 4.2 hours

I'll update this thread if it pumps 👀"

**Afternoon** 📊
"I analyzed the top 10 pump.fun wallets.

They all share 3 traits:

1. Entry timing: Buy within first 10 min
2. Position sizing: 2-5 SOL per trade
3. Exit discipline: Sell at 3x or cut at -20%

No rocket science. Just consistency."

**Evening** 🎯
"Update on $PEPE from this morning:

🟢 Entry: $0.00012
🟢 Now: $0.00089
🟢 Gain: 7.4x in 9 hours

The wallet sold half at 5x, riding the rest.

This is why tracking smart money works.

Beta signups: [link]"

### Day 3 (Wednesday)

**Morning** 💬
"Question: Would you pay $49/mo to get alerted when profitable wallets buy?

Assuming it helps you catch even 1 good play per month, seems like a no-brainer.

But I want to hear from real traders. Worth it or nah?"

**Afternoon** 📊
"The #1 mistake I see on pump.fun:

People track TOKEN launches.

They should track WALLET behavior.

Tokens come and go.
Smart wallets print forever.

Shift your focus."

**Evening** 🔥
"Mini case study: Wallet FcP2...nR9k

Last 30 days:
- 18 trades
- 14 wins, 4 losses
- 78% win rate
- +890% total ROI

Every win = 5x to 20x.
Every loss = -15% to -30%.

Asymmetric risk. This is how you win."

### Day 4 (Thursday)

**Morning** 📊
"Data: Average pump.fun token lifecycle

Hour 0-1: Peak volume (smart money enters)
Hour 1-6: Retail enters (fomo phase)
Hour 6-24: Dump begins
Day 2+: Ghost town

If you're buying after hour 1, you're exit liquidity.

Track the wallets in hour 0."

**Afternoon** 🔥
"Beta user feedback (Day 4):

\"Got 3 alerts yesterday. Took 1 trade. 8x in 5 hours. Already worth it.\" - @anon_trader

This is the vision. Find smart money. Copy smart money. Win.

2 beta slots left: [link]"

**Evening** 💬
"Controversial take:

You don't need to understand the project.
You don't need to read the roadmap.
You don't need to join the Telegram.

Just follow wallets that consistently 10x.

Agree or disagree?"

### Day 5 (Friday)

**Morning** 🔥
"🚨 Another W for tracked wallet

Wallet aBc9...Def2:
- Bought $MOON at $0.0003 (4 hours ago)
- Now at $0.0021
- 7x gain
- Wallet score: 82/100

Pattern: This wallet ONLY buys tokens with:
- <$50K mcap
- <500 holders
- Active TG

I'm documenting everything."

**Afternoon** 📊
"How I calculate wallet \"score\" (0-100):

40% - Win rate
30% - 7-day ROI
15% - Trading volume
15% - Recent activity

Wallets 70+ = trackable
Wallets 80+ = elite

Only 8% of wallets score 70+."

**Evening** 🎯
"Week 1 beta results:

5 users
18 alerts sent
11 trades taken
9 wins, 2 losses
82% win rate
Avg gain: 6.2x

This works.

Public launch Monday.
